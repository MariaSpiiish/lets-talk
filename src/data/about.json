All she wanted to do was fictionalize her mundane reality and cultivate 'her aristocratic tastes and feelings*.'\n But alas, despite her love for all things refinement, she was clumsy and chatty and boisterous and always got herself into trouble. Just like her favorite book character, Anne of Green Gables. Nevertheless, she didnâ€™t lose either hope or heart to share her love for classic literature and cozy pictures."
