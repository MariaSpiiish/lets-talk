All she wanted to do was fictionalize her mundane reality and cultivate 'her aristocratic tastes and feelings*.'\n But alas, despite her love for all things refinement, she was clumsy and chatty and boisterous and always got herself into trouble. Just like her favorite book character, Anne of Green Gables. Nevertheless, she didn’t lose either hope or heart to share her love for classic literature and cozy pictures."

            "text": "'Who am I?' – a question of identity, an eternal question that each of us has asked themselves at least once in a lifetime. \n I think this question is so never-ending because of the nature of human beings. We are ever changing trying on new “skins”, shedding old ones, evolving. \n The identities that define me at the moment are a teacher (of English), a struggling web-developer, a runner, a restless traveler, a wife (like the best wife ever, of course), a daughter. And I hope to grow other identities in the future. If you can keep a secret, I’ll let you in on a glimpse of my to-be identity: a campsite owner. \n All in all, with this app, I’m hoping to appeal to your identity of an English enthusiast, looking for ways to polish your speaking skills with engaging, thought-provoking topics. \n If you’re willing to reach out and share your thoughts on the app, suggest improvement or discuss collaboration, don’t hesitate to contact me using the contact information provided below."
