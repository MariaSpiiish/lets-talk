#### Description:

The project is a single page app developed using React library written on TypeScript with CSS animation and GSAP animation library. The project also includes a collapsible accordion component from AntDesign library and a Tooltip component to ensure friendly UI.

:house: The user starts on a Home Page with a list of discussion topics to choose from. By clicking on a chosen topic the user gets redirected to the topic page.

:page_facing_up: Topic page includes a video or an article which is there to stimulate the discussion. Discussion questions on the topic are below the video or the article.

:white_check_mark: Once the topic is discussed it may be marked as discussed. Thus, the discussed topics route gets filled in with the list of discussed topics and the topic itself is deleted from the homepage, though it can be accessed through the discussed topic route as well.

:dancer: About page provides information about the developer and the coauthor of the content.

:sailboat: The app is easy to navigate following links both in the header and the footer of the page.
