#### Description:
A web app to help English enthusiasts to improve their speaking skills.

The project is a single-page app developed using the React library, written in TypeScript, with CSS animations and the GSAP animation library. The project also includes a collapsible accordion component and a Tooltip component from the AntDesign library to ensure a user-friendly UI. Semantic HTML is utilized throughout the app to enhance accessibility and improve the overall structure of the content.

:house: The user starts on a Home Page with a list of discussion topics to choose from. By clicking on a chosen topic, the user is redirected to the topic page.

:page_facing_up: The Topic page includes a video or an article designed to stimulate discussion. Below the video or article, there are discussion questions related to the topic.

:white_check_mark: Once a topic has been discussed, it can be marked as discussed. The discussed topics route then fills with a list of topics that have been completed, and the topic itself is removed from the homepage. However, it can still be accessed through the discussed topics route.

:dancer: The About page provides information about the developer and the co-author of the content.

:sailboat: The app is easy to navigate, with links available in both the header and footer of the page.
